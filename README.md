# CLox (WIP)

An interpreter of the [Lox](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters) scripting language, implemented in C.

Lox is a tiny scripting language described in [Bob Nystrom](https://stuffwithstuff.com/)'s book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). I've already written an tree-walk interpreter using TypesScript, called [TSLox](https://github.com/zlliang/tslox). This C version is a bytecode virtual machine, developed along with reading [Part III](https://craftinginterpreters.com/a-bytecode-virtual-machine.html) of the book. _I'm still working on it._
